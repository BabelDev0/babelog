Keep your thougts Good. Not Bad. 

Keep your thougts Decent. Not Indecent. 

Keep your thougts full of faith and not doubt

because it is in your thoughts that is determined 

whether you will be happy or unhappy.

whether you will be healthy or unhealthy.

the happiest person is who thinks the happiest,

most interesting, finest thoughts.
